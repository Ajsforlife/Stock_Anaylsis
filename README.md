### VBA Stock Analysis
The analysis of several stocks using VBA macros in excel to automate the process of collecting data.


## Overview of Project
This project was to automate the compiling of data from stocks in a spreadsheet and use that data to get automated returns based on simple input of the Year of the data used.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to successful write VBA code that would compile data without actually having to do the work manually in excel. There were many things learned in this assignment including the basics of visual basics coding. The main things we calculate are the Total Daily Volume and the % return over the course of different years. We also learnedhow to create buttons linked to the macros we created which help make the process even easier for the users of the automated spreadsheet. If there was more data collected on any tickers and commpiled into a spreadsheet this code would work aslong as sheet is assigned a date for a name.

## Analysis and Challenges
This project was extremely informative and complex, however the output of the data looks really well done for simple button clicks and year inputs.

The first set of data was stock data from 2017 which the image above shows there was great success across the clean energy sector of the stock.

However the second set of data compiled from 2018 which the image above shows there was a much lower success rate of clean energy stocks. with only 2 of the tickers in the spreadsheet were gainers on the year. (if Tesla was in this data im sure the results would of been slightly different for Tesla ) It also took the second set of data slightly longer to run the macro, then the first set.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There were actually many challenges encountered in this challenge. The most difficult part for me was figuring out how to use an array as variables and also designating he array to start at 0 which the following 2 images will show examples of how i set the array to start at 0 and how i used a word variable to run the code.

All in all the code is pretty straight forward based on the modules except for the array portion they wanted us to include. I learned a lot about how to use VBA and how to make buttons for macros for the average person to use. 

## Results
I have a much better understanding of the purpose and use of VBA for the future and will continue to grow with my coding knowledge.
### Summary

-  What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
Personally my refactored code ran just as well as my original, im sure there was a much more elegant and quicker way to code this challenge but I got the results as required. Refactoring did help me reveiw many concepts learned in the module and helped me with my coding experience.
I have found many different answers to the same coding question which is something i thoroughly enjoy. Some disadvantages were spending large amounts of time to figure out how to use arrays more thoroughly.

- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
The pros were helping me personally master what I learned in the module and learning different ways to combine multiple macros into one that makes everything work at the click of a button. A con i found was that arrays are not easily used like variables. and require much more know how to solve the same problem but also makes the code easier to understand instead of having multiple letter variables scattered through the code.
